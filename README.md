# Transcriptomic profiling of PD brains

## Background

This repository contains analysis code for the publication found [here](add link). In this pubblication we performed RNA-sequencing after ribosomal RNA removal of 84 frontal cortex samples. Samples were collected postmortem from 23 non-neurological individuals and 61 individuals with varying degree of Î±-synuclein-related pathology. The latter were samples collected from donors with iLDB, PD or PDD and were split into three neuropathological groups based on their Braak stage: one group consisting of individuals at Braak stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (n = 19), one group consisting of individuals at Braak stage 5 (n = 19) and one group consisting of individuals at Braak stage 6 (n = 23). Cell composition was assessed for all the samples. Differential expression analysis was performed both across neuropathological stages and in a pairwise manner.
